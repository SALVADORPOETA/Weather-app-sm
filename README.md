# Weather App

This is a weather app built with ReactJS. It gets the API with Axios. I added a sidebar that was originally built with vanilla JavaScript but I used ChatGPT to translate it into ReactJS, then I fixed all the bugs manually. You can open the sidebar clicking on the menu icon. The content of the sidebar is not related to the weather app but I let it as in the original so I could practice the react-icons integration. It is deployed on Vercel and it's better displayed on desktop.
